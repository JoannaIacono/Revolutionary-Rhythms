<h1 style="font-family:garamond; font-size:100; text-align:center; color:red">Coldplay</h1>
<p style="font-family:garamond; font-size:100; text-align:center">Coldplay is a world-wide renowned British rock band that has attracted thousands of people with their heartfelt melodies, iconic choruses, and introspective lyric.  Let’s find out a bit more about them.
</p>
 <br>
<p1 style="font-family:garamond; font-size:50; text-align:center;">Cause you're a sky, 'cause you're a sky full of stars!
Coldplay is always able to surprise the audience with its catchy lyric. Formed in 1996, the band is formed by lead vocalist Chris Martin, guitarist Jonny Buckland, bassist Guy Berryman, and drummer Will Champion. A little side note, Phil Harvey is known as the creative director of the band, which makes him the fifth “essence” of the band. They met at the University College of London and, after having changed the band’s name a few times between 1996 and 1998, at the end “Coldplay” was the final choice, which was inspired by a book of children’s poems called “Child’s Reflections: Cold Play”.

<p2 style="font-family:garamond; font-size:50; text-align:center;">Now, let’s have a look at Coldplay’s multiple souls which mix multiple genres. Coldplay is a rock band. Like other UK pop-rock bands, they started in the 90s. We found 107 pop-rock music bands in the UK. But let’s be honest: the charm of Chris Martin is way too strong!
<br>
Are you curious about the most famous songs? Well, if you look at the stars, and look how they shine for you, you can see that it was all YELLOW! (By the way, Yellow is THE song that bestowed their worldwide fame) Come on, we know you listen to it when you need a good cry! But the greatest thing about Coldplay is that you can listen to them both when you are in the middle of a drama, and when you feel like you are the happiest person on earth. If you want to celebrate life and need good vibes then listen to their colorful “Hymn for the Weekend”, “Viva la Vida” and you are gonna find out a pa-pa-pa-paradise. Instead, if you need to be the main (dramatic) character of your life, weep all your tears but at least with a good soundtrack: we recommend “Fix You” and “The Scientist” especially when you are struggling with something, remember nobody said it was easy!
<br>
There is only one flaw about Coldplay: they make you spend all of your money to buy their numerous albums. The albums that made us scream the most are “Parachutes” (2000), “Ghost Stories” (2014), and “A Head Full of Dreams” (2015). <br> 
Did you know that “Parachutes” has been classified as one of the best 100 albums of the 2000s? In this album, Coldplay is able to express the immediacy of the feelings thanks to primarily acoustic sounds, simple but really effective. <br> 
“Ghost Stories” is characterized by more electronic sonorities and is an invitation to free the ghosts of the past which continue to hunt our present. Now, can you get the reason why Coldplay is so great? They speak about universal feelings using a universal language. <br>
Last but not least the dreamiest of the album “A Head Full of Dreams”, is characterized by funk sounds never previously experienced. The central theme is the rebirth after a fall, an invitation to feeling alive again, after a period of pain. 
<br>
The revolutionary thing about them is not just to have a charismatic leader (screams for Chris Martin), but their ability to craft emotionally charged and introspective songs that connect deeply with the audience. Coldplay is able to talk about the human experience, evoking strong emotions and forging a deep connection with listeners around the world.
<br>
We have said a lot, but we should let their music speak for us. So, let’s be influenced by their sonic journey and get a source of solace, inspiration, and unity with Coldplay.
