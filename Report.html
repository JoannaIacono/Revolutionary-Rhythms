          <h2>Måneskin</h2>
       
          <p> This report aims at explaining the methodology that we used to explore the history of Måneskin, one of the most revolutionary rock bands of all times. Formed in 2016, this band has captured the hearts of music enthusiasts worldwide, with their edgy performances and their rebellious spirit. It has reached massive international success, especially after winning the European Song Contest in 2021, becoming the leading exporters of Italian culture all over the world. Today this group continues to redefine the boundaries of modern rock music. <br> <br>
In progressively broader storytelling, we firstly decided to provide an overview of their music genre - rock’ n’ roll - in Italy, starting from the most famous Italian bands and their structure. Then, we focused on the band itself, in particular, we looked for information about its components, their sources of inspiration, the instruments they play, their most popular songs and their achievements. Lastly, we discovered more about the frontman, Damiano David by running queries about his occupations, the languages he speaks, his hobbies and the number of followers that he has on social media. <br> <br>
To start off our research, we approached the <b> Polifonia </b> interrogation tool, searching in the <b> MusicBo corpus </b> lemmas that we later used to formulate our queries. For instance, by doing so, we found out that the lemma “band” was more suited for our purpose than “group”, because not only does it have a higher number of occurrences (593), but it is also more specific since, as shown by the type concept tool, it refers to a group of musicians playing together. Then, we learned that, in order to carry out the query about Måneskin’s sources of inspiration, we needed to employ the lemma “influence” rather than “inspiration”, as the latter counts only 120 occurrences, while the first 559.  The same goes for the lemma “occupation”, used for our focus on Damiano David, which occurred 55 times, while its synonym “job” had much lesser sentences related to it (17). </p>
