          <h2>Måneskin</h2>
       
          <p> This report aims at explaining the methodology that we used to explore the history of Måneskin, one of the most revolutionary rock bands of all times. Formed in 2016, this band has captured the hearts of music enthusiasts worldwide, with their edgy performances and their rebellious spirit. It has reached massive international success, especially after winning the European Song Contest in 2021, becoming the leading exporters of Italian culture all over the world. Today this group continues to redefine the boundaries of modern rock music. <br> <br>
In progressively broader storytelling, we firstly decided to provide an overview of their music genre - rock’ n’ roll - in Italy, starting from the most famous Italian bands and their structure. Then, we focused on the band itself, in particular, we looked for information about its components, their sources of inspiration, the instruments they play, their most popular songs and their achievements. Lastly, we discovered more about the frontman, Damiano David by running queries about his occupations, the languages he speaks, his hobbies and the number of followers that he has on social media. <br> <br>
To start off our research, we approached the <b> Polifonia </b> interrogation tool, searching in the <b> MusicBo corpus </b> lemmas that we later used to formulate our queries. For instance, by doing so, we found out that the lemma “band” was more suited for our purpose than “group”, because not only does it have a higher number of occurrences (593), but it is also more specific since, as shown by the type concept tool, it refers to a group of musicians playing together. Then, we learned that, in order to carry out the query about Måneskin’s sources of inspiration, we needed to employ the lemma “influence” rather than “inspiration”, as the latter counts only 120 occurrences, while the first 559.  The same goes for the lemma “occupation”, used for our focus on Damiano David, which occurred 55 times, while its synonym “job” had much lesser sentences related to it (17). </p>

          <h2>Coldplay</h2>
          <p> The aim of the following report is to examine the methodology used to create our story, which focuses on the pop-rock band Coldplay. With their emotionally charged songs and breathtaking performances, this group has bewitched generations of listeners around the world over the past two decades. By personal choice, our narrative goes from a specific to a general point of view, starting from the details concerning our band of interest to a quick look at UK’s pop-rock bands. <br> <br>
To begin with, we indicated the formation date, followed by a photo of the band, their names and birthdate. Given the charisma of the leader, we also opted for a photo representing Chris Martin only. Secondly, we featured the instruments they play, and their music genre with an in-depth analysis on bands sharing both Coldplay’s genre and country of origin. Furthermore, we included the influences that inspired them, songs, and albums that made them climb the ladder of success. To conclude, a final broad overview: the number of pop rock bands from the UK and the start year of their activity. <br> <br>

Our first step was checking the Polifonia corpus, a multilingual diachronic corpus focused on Musical Heritage. It was essential to find more about the linguistic contexts of the words employed to create our queries. Here we present two examples. First, to create the query which shows Coldplay’s members, we compared the lemmas ‘member’ and ‘component’ employing the module MusicBo: the former is associated with 655 sentences, including performing arts instances (ex. […] several of the members of the orchestra came to me […]), while ‘component’ occurs in 39 sentences, mainly referring to a part of a whole, rather than people of a group in a musical context. <br> <br>
Due to few results with MusicBo, we opted for Wikipedia module for the second example: by comparing the lemmas ‘band’ and ‘group’, we discovered that both are associated with more than 100,000 sentences; however, the former is more connected with musical topics, such as EP, singles, albums, formation year or recording (ex. […] the band released third regular studio album […]). On the other hand, ‘group’ also appears in musical contexts (ex. […] the group toured extensively […]), but based on common knowledge, it is a concept that is usually employed in many fields besides music (ex. religion) so it prompted us to center our choice on ‘band’, since it is predominant in the music environment. <br> <br>

          <h2>Imagine Dragons</h2>
          <p> Another important band characterizing our report is the Imagine Dragons. With their distinctive sound and profound lyrics, this American pop rock band has mesmerized countless individuals, imprinting an unforgettable impression on the music scene. We started with a general overview of the number of pop rock music bands all over the USA and their related activity period. Then, we focused on the number of members of pop rock bands in the USA. Afterwards, we moved on a more specific pop rock band, namely, the Imagine Dragons, taking into account both their members and birthplace. In addition, we explored the publication date of their albums, and their 10 most influential songs. The final part of our story dealt with the instruments played by the Imagine Dragons, with a special focus on the electric guitar. <br> <br>
        

The starting point of our semantic research was The Polifonia corpus, which allowed us to explore the meaning and the concepts of the words used to create our story. We used the MusicBo Module to look for the “rock” lemma, but the results were pretty poor. This is why we delved into the conceptual form of the term and the data obtained were limited to the rock ‘n roll context. However, our story’s focal point was the pop rock music genre and, therefore, we used the Wikidata knowledge graph to obtain more specific results in line with our story objective. <br> <br>
Our story’s main character is the Imagine Dragons. Indeed, a crucial word we used to create our story was “band”. How did we get here? To start with, the first expression that we came up with was “musical group”. The MusicBo Module provided us with only one concept and our query did not have entities connected with the abovementioned expression. Besides, the phrase was associated with 0 sentences. Consequently, we decided to opt for a synonym, which was “band”. In fact, we obtained more concepts and through the Wikipedia Module, we found the exact collocation we were looking for (pop rock band). <br> <br>
 </p>
 
   <h2> <u>Methodology</u> </h2>
   <p>By utilizing the MusicBo "module," we had the opportunity to observe the real-life usage of words like "composer" and "theatre," which later guided our inquiries. This was particularly helpful in understanding the common associations of the word "classical," which was crucial for our data search. Nouns such as "composer," "composition," and "music" served as a starting point for our research on Wikidata. In instances where we couldn't find any Wikidata matches, we turned to Polifonia's "Type concept" tool to search for synonyms. For example, when we were searching for classical songs created by players, knowing that "musician" was a synonym for "player" helped us retrieve the necessary data. <br> <br>

In order to create the queries, we leveraged the FRED tool to gain a clearer representation of the queries and to identify the appropriate entities. Then we shifted our focus on Wikidata, where we could find the elements and properties, we wanted to analyze through their corresponding wd and wdt codes. We used the Wikidata Query Service to run our queries in accordance with the specific topic of our stories. <br> <br>

After getting our queries, we uploaded them on Melody and had a visual representation of the queries through the use of tables, linecharts, doughnutcharts, maps and counters. These tools were crucial to achieve our goal: telling different stories about three captivating bands that have revolutionized our generation with their spellbinding music. </p>

 <h2> <u>Challenges</u> </h2>
 <p>We faced challenges of different natures while carrying out the project. Firstly, we had to change the object of our queries many times due to the lack of data on Wikidata (for instance, we could not create maps concerning concert locations of the bands of our interest). Secondly, there were times when, even if we could retrieve results from Wikidata Query Service, these would either not work on Melody or seem unreliable and not up to date. Furthermore, several problems were detected while working on Melody. To begin with, the platform is rather slow at publishing stories and updating the order of the content. On top of that, it did not always save the edits made, therefore obliging us to do them all over again. Overall, despite the project being quite enriching in terms of informatics competence, it could have gone smoother with the aid of better-functioning tools. </p>
