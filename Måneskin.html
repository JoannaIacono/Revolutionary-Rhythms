          <p><strong>If you are beggin' to know more about this band that has completely revolutionized the history of Italian rock music, then you are in the right place!!</strong> <br>
          
Out of the 39 rock bands that have formed in Italy over the years, Måneskin is definitely the one that has left an indelible mark on the music of our country. <br>
The name they chose already conveys the uniqueness of this band: Måneskin is a Dansih word that means moonlight and it was suggested by the bassist Victoria De Angelis who wanted to pay tribute to her Danish origins.
It’s difficult to believe that this well-renown group of young people – the eldest, Damiano, is only 24 years old! – started their career performing on the streets of Rome before achieving notoriety, but it’s the truth. <br>
The band members, namely the bassist Victoria De Angelis, the guitarist Thomas Raggi, the lead vocalist Damiano David, and the drummer Ethan Torchio, met when they were in high school and shared the same untamable passion for rock music. That’s why they decided to put themselves out there participating in the eleventh season of the Italian version of X Factor in 2017. Even if they came second, thanks to this experience they began their climb to success gaining more and more visibility until they reached international fame winning the Eurovision Song Contest in 2021 with Zitti e buoni. From this point on they were showered with awards and nominations, including the Billboard Music Award for Top Rock Song for their masterpiece Beggin’ in 2022. <br>
But what is it that makes this band so special? Maybe it’s their edgy style that mixes rock, pop and glam that aims at translating the greatness of the music of the past into modernity, or maybe it’s the power of the themes that they explore with their lyrics that delve into the depths of desire, self-discovery and freedom, but what is certain is that they have managed to win the hearts of millions of people all around the world.
When you press play on a Måneskin track, be prepared to unleash your wild side and to be brought to another timezone: let yourself be carried away by their raw energy and break free from the shackles that hold you back, have fear for nobady! <br> <br>
