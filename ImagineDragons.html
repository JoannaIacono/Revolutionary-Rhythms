          <p><strong>Imagine Dragons is an American pop rock band has gained a world-wide popularity with their attractive mixing of genre. Let’s explore their world of hypnotic and variegated rhythms.</strong> Whatever it takes! <br>
No, of course we are not referring to Mario Draghi’s quote pronounced on 2021 about the European sovereign debt crisis. Instead, we are mentioning the outstanding performances of the Imagine Dragons.
Formed in 2008 in Las Vegas, the band is formed by lead vocalist Dan Reynolds, guitarist Wayne Sermon, bassist Ben McKee, and drummer Daniel Platzman. This American rock band has captivated millions of hearts and minds with their unique sound and heartfelt lyrics, leaving an indelible mark on the music industry. Allow us to take you on a journey through their incredible legacy and share why Imagine Dragons deserves your unwavering attention. <br>

As the Coldplay they started at university, but in Brigham Young University of Provo. (This is your sign to start performing during your university years!). The name alone conjures up a sense of magic, power, and limitless creativity. <br>

Wanna know more about his most influential songs? Well, it’s time to begin, isn’t it?  “It’s time” is an anthem for a personal transformation. It’s an invitation for the listener to break free from the constrains of the past and face personal challenges and affirm proudly that I’m never changing who I am. If you want to feel the strongest person on hearth, then you must listen to “Believer” and let be transported by unuplifting and energetic sound. We assure you that you will see the beauty through the pain and you will be inspired to keep fighting and never give up. Feeling blue? Don’t worry! This band has the perfect soundtrack even when the sky turns gray and everything is screaming. Imagine Dragons will always remind you that after a bad day, there is always a chance to be on top of the world!

So, don’t you know which album to start from? We recommend “Night Visions” released in 2012 which contains some of his most popular and well-known songs including “Radioactive”, “Demons”, “It’s Time”, and “On top of the World”. Another album you can’t miss is “Evolve” that blend catchy hooks and energetic beats and contain other major hits such as “Believer”, “Thunder” and “Whatever it takes”.

The incredible thing about Imagine Dragons is their ability to blend rock, hip-hop, folk and pop with lyrics that delve into introspective and emotionally charged themes such as resilience, personal struggles, pain. <br> 

Enough talking! Let their energetic music speak for them and let their overwhelming rhythms carry you away! <br>
